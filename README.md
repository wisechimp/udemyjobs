# udemyjobs
The final project from Advanced React Native on Udemy.

This project incorporated logging in with Facebook plus using Maps to search for and present jobs from an API. The course implemented Facebook and Maps integration with Expo but I wanted to get my hands a little dirtier (and I certainly did!) by not using Expo at all.

The app exposed me to:

1) React Navigation
2) Using ScrollView to create a swipeable welcome/tutorial screen for when the user first opens the app
3) Authentication using Facebook with Firebase
4) React Native Maps

plus additional exposure to Redux and Axios.
